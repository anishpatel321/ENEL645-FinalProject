# ENEL645 Final Project - Group 23

## Project Overview
This project by Group 23 for the ENEL 645 course explores facial expression recognition using both traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced Transfer Learning models. Our analysis and model training are based on the FER-2013 dataset.

### Dataset Description
The FER-2013 dataset comprises 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces, with the faces automatically aligned to ensure consistency across images. The dataset includes a training set with 28,709 examples and a public test set with 3,589 examples.

## Study Findings
In this study, we explored various CNN and Transfer Learning models to identify the most effective approach for facial expression recognition. It's important to note that the dataset used in this study excludes 'Neutral' and 'Disgusted' classes to align with our research focus.

The results of our best-performing models are summarized in the `model_info.xlsx` file, which provides a detailed comparison of model performances. The highest validation accuracy achieved in our study was 75.1%, demonstrating the potential of these models in recognizing facial expressions.

## Conclusion
Our exploration into facial expression recognition through CNNs and Transfer Learning models has yielded promising results, with significant potential for further research and application in real-world scenarios.
